#### 2021 January  @ Durg ####

In MIG -525, 
Is one of hell’s hive.   
Spiders in bathroom,  
The lizards are in the living room,   
Rats move when you sleep in the bedroom.   
Your worst nightmare is coming for you,  
Satan is sending an army for you,  
This is my grandmother’s house.  

In the granary there you’ll find a large mouse.   
Squeak, squeak, squeak.  
Doors in this house make creepy   
Creak, creak, creak.  
My grandmothers love never fading,   
Always hearty and caring  
But at her house there will be screaming.   
Hell’s here to invite you.  
Yes, it’s my grandmother’s house.
