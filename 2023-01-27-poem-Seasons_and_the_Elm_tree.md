<p class="has-text-centered is-size-2">Seasons and the Elm tree</p>
<p class="has-text-centered">
</br>
Here stand the lonely elm tree</br>
Rooted to the ground</br>
While its young little leaves swing free</br>
In the cool breeze that blows around</br>
</br>
Now Lo, behold!</br>
Here comes the wonderful summer</br>
Life abounds!</br>
The  ground is lush and lime green</br> 
A glorious leaves of parakeet green</br>
Against the clear blue sky</br>
</br>
Now Lo behold!</br>
Here comes the ghostly winter</br> 
Where no life is seen</br>
The weather is a bully; wicked, harsh and mean</br>
Where only the Ravens cry </br>
The tree lies naked, its green lustre gone</br> 
Just bare wood, merely just wheat brown</br>
Against the deathly grey atmosphere</br>
</br>
Now lo behold!</br>
Here comes the rejuvenating spring</br>
The leaves are back</br>
A new lease on life</br>
Freed from the ice </br>
The grass dots the former barren lithosphere</br>
That surrounds the lonely elm tree</br>
</br>
