In the tropical forests
A deadly predator rests
Silent as a shadow
And has no foe
Top of the food chain
Lurks from the tall grass, bush and cane His eyes burn yellow
And he is a sleek, silent dangerous fellow Here stands the lonely doe
Unaware her end is nigh
Jumps out of the tall grass
A black-orange mass
Tearing off her skin
For the tiger,
Sustenance has been earned
For the sweet flesh he has earned
Deadly as an assasin
For the tiger it is
A blessing, a feast and another kill
