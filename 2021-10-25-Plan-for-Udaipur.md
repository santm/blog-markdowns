With the number of cases of covid getting reduced we with lots of anxiety thought of planning a trip during  Dassera school vacation.

We were not sure what would be the best destination in this current situation. Were not sure on so many things like should we fly ? should we drive ? go near by only. Too many variables and anxiety as we always look into our past for an answer and there was none for this time. 

At the end, we decided to plan a trip around Udaipur, Rajasthan. The initial plan was to fly to Ahmedabad and rest for a day,  self driving car from there. We booked Club Mahindra Udaipur and one near Ahmedabad *(thinking to explore near by places once again)*. That was it there nothing else in the list. but as time progressed things started to change...

After few weeks the initial plan was to visit ***Udaipur, Kumbhalgarh, Ranakpur, Jojawar and Jawai.*** Talked to few friends who had been there in recent time. But when it came to book flight tickets realized the price for flying to Udaipur and Ahmedabad is same and there is no point of driving 300KM if our destinations are around Udaipur.

With input from [Uttam](https://indibirding.com/) & [Ragesh](https://www.instagram.com/the_travelling_biriyani_belly/) the trip planned came out to be like this....

Now Jojawar got dropped and Mt. Abu got added with few tweak. 

Rajasthan, *(the land of kings)* is divided into many regions on the basis of different languages, culture and traditions. Udaipur is part of Mewar region where MahaRana Pratap ruled. This part of Rajasthan is completely different from Jaipur/Jodhpur we visited many years back, lots of green and cooler compared to them.

Luckily all our stay except Bera-Jawai was confirmed with **Club-Mahindra**,  when I booked them it was initially wait-list and had to tweak our itinerary  based on resort availability.   

Uttam arranged one travel partner for all our car need based out of Udaipur it is not perfect but worked out best for the trip.
