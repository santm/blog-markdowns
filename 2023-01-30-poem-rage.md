Oh the feeling of rage  
Because I am no priest or sage  
For the fact  
My veins are intact are surprising  
With the truth, my heart was beating so fast   
I expect my veins to burst  
And my blood is rage red  
My face contorts like a gargolye  
My sanity is cast,  
Thrown into the abyss of my heart  

Oh how the demon of anger  
Destroys all my alliances  
fills my head full of violent thoughts and murder  
Until it's too late and I realize my actions  
Have got my soul and spirit curst
