<p class="has-text-centered is-size-2">Rage</p>
<p class="has-text-centered">
Oh the feeling of rage</br>
Because I am no priest or sage</br>
For the fact</br>
My veins are intact are surprising</br>
With the truth, my heart was beating so fast</br> 
I expect my veins to break</br>
And my blood is rage red</br>
My face contorts like a gargolye</br>
My sanity is cast,</br>
Thrown into the abyss of my heart</br>
My fists tighten</br>
</br>


I am still trying</br> 
To prevent the bloodshed</br>
But I lose the fight</br>
To my inner devil</br>
I start the fight</br>
With blows that crumble my enemies</br> 
I enter the bloody combat with all my might</br>
</br>
Its when they ask to be forgiven</br> 
And they are bruised and bleeding on the ground</br> 
That when i stop fighting</br>
And on the anvil</br>
Of my tongue, words of redemption and mercy</br>
Come meaningfullly out</br>
Or venom i spew and curses I shout</br>
For you sin</br>
Against me</br>
Watch and see</br>
The beast within me</br>
Awaken ready to kill</br>
Until it has had itâ€™s fill</br>
