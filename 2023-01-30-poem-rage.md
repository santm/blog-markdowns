Oh the feeling of rage
Because I am no priest or sage
For the fact
My veins are intact are surprising
With the truth, my heart was beating so fast 
I expect my veins to burst
And my blood is rage red
My face contorts like a gargolye
My sanity is cast,
Thrown into the abyss of my heart

Oh how the demon of anger
Destroys all my alliances
fills my head full of violent thoughts and murder
Until it's too late and I realize my actions
Have got my soul and spirit curst
