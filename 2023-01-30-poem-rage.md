<p class="has-text-centered is-size-2">Rage</p>
<p class="has-text-centered">
Oh the feeling of rage</br>
Because I am no priest or sage</br>
For the fact</br>
My veins are intact are surprising</br>
With the truth, my heart was beating so fast</br> 
I expect my veins to burst</br>
And my blood is rage red</br>
My face contorts like a gargolye</br>
My sanity is cast,</br>
Thrown into the abyss of my heart</br>
</br>
Oh how the demon of anger</br>
Destroys all my alliances</br>
fills my head full of violent thoughts and murder</br>
Until it's too late and I realize my actions</br>
Have got my soul and spirit curst </br>
