I started a SD starter in the month of May 2021 inspired  by one fellow runner.I followed [this link ](https://www.feastingathome.com/sourdough-starter/)to make the starter with whole wheat. The starter was very active with the April heat in Bangalore from Day-2 onwards. I continued the process till day 7 and ended up with lots of SD discards as I was using 120gm fresh feed every time. The rise and doubling was happening fine even though the starter passed the so-called "float test". [The pictures from that journey.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/3QHMr2yVghGhS9Na6)

The bread baked with that starter was very sour. And I was quite disappointed honestly. After spending 40-50 hours on YouTube it was quite disappointing. I could not understand what went wrong.

Bread only has four ingredients Flour, water , salt and yeast. And incase of SD the yeast is also nothing but flour and water mixed over the last few days. Comparing it to a  cake where you have butter, sugar to cover up any mistakes here there is none. So that is why bread making is so difficult :)

Suddenly one of my friends mentioned [KrumbKraft ](https://krumbkraft.in/)and I immediately ordered bread from them. After that I ordered from 2 more places but nothing came close to KrumbKraft, and suddenly an opportunity opened up to join virtual class with KrumbKraft and I signed up  immediately. But in the back of my mind I  was calculating that maybe I should have used that money to order their bread on a regular basis and could have bought bread for years to come :) :)

I started a new starter which somehow did not raise and was not responding at all while others in Bangalore had great progress with their starter. So after a week I started 2 more starter and once on our kitchen counter it was full of bottles. But the good part this time I was using 20gm/40gm flour as feed so discard was not huge like last time.

It was really fun to learn with others. Post the course I baked 5 bread, while my bread making skill has improved, it is going to be a lifelong journey to hone the skill of bread making.

Feel free to reach out if you are going  to bake bread. I hope I can share a few pointers which might help you. I am not going to list anything in this post as everyone's journey is unique and never equal.
