<p class="has-text-centered is-size-2">Ballad of the Soldier</p>
<p class="has-text-centered">
Here they stand</br>
Brave and strong</br>
Where the frigid mountain wind howls a tragic song</br>
A melody of sorrow and despair</br>
They are away from home, shelter, or care</br>
</br>
Here they march</br>
Their footsteps rattle the earth</br>
Their faces betray no emotion of misery, anger, pain, or mirth</br>
Their trusty guns at their side</br>
The regiment at itâ€™s  might</br>
The soldiers march to the battle-field ready for the fight</br>
</br>
On this battleground</br>
Where the dying and dead are strewn around</br>
They bravely attack, protect, and martyr themselves</br>
With bullets and bombs, for their dedication</br>
Protects our nation</br>
