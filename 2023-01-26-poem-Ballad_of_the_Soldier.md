Here they stand
Brave and strong
Where the frigid mountain wind howls a tragic song
A melody of sorrow and despair
They are away from home, shelter, or care

Here they march
Their footsteps rattle the earth
Their faces betray no emotion of misery, anger, pain, or mirth
Their trusty guns at their side
The regiment at it's  might
The soldiers march to the battle-field ready for the fight

On this battleground
Where the dying and dead are strewn around
They bravely attack, protect, and martyr themselves
With bullets and bombs, for their dedication
Protects our nation
