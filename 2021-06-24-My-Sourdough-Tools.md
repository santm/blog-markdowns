Honestly I feel there is no need for me to put a post on the tools you need for your sourdough or bread journey. There are zillions of articles and videos already out there on internet. 

>I am going to list down the hardware I gathered in my kitchen over the years and which I found useful. And in general they are useful in their own right and could be used for other things. For example our Dutch-Oven has cooked more **single pot pasta**  than anything else.

- **A big oven** - Good to have ; mine is Faber 60 Lt Electric almost 8 years old now. The best one to get would be a steam oven or at least a oven which can go higher temperature. Recent time there are many choices in Indian market like IKEA, Siemens, Bosch, Miele and etc.
- **Dutch Oven** (Casserole) - Good to have ; mine is  Wonderchef Ferro Cast-Iron Oval Casserole 4.4L. 
- **Banneton** (Proofing Basket) - Oval/Oblong from Bakewale; **not a must** 
- **Razor/Blade** - Simple Shaving Blade, in French it is called *Lame*. Internet is full of fancy one; you do not need them. You start holding the naked blade and you can control it better.
- **Shower Caps** - Plastic Bags to cover the bread.
- **Tea Towels** - to keep dough damp.
- **Preachment Paper** - Oddy Ecobake ; not must I baked without but make life easier.
- **Spray bottle** - To spray water on dough in the end
- **Glass Jar** - with lid, for storing sourdough starter
- **Measuring Cup** - minimum size 500 ml
- **Weighing scale** - **A MUST** 
- **Silicone Mat** - keeps your work surface clean, easy to manage dough.
- **Scrapper** - **A MUST**, they are extension of your hand without  your finger being sticky
- **Hand mixer** - In recent time I started to use the hand mixer with dough hook for kneading and I must confess it makes things easy. So you can assume life will be lot easier with stand mixer if you bake a lot.
- **Chop Stick** - This is my tool of choice to mix flour and water, you can buy a fancy Danish Dough Whisk Stainless Steel as well :)
- **Silicone spatula** - makes scraping easy.
- **Loaf Tin** - Making loaf, banana bread many other use.
