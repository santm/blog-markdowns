In the tropical forests  
A deadly predator rests  
Silent as a shadow  
And has no foe  
Top of the food chain  
Lurks from the tall grass, bush and cane His eyes burn yellow  
And he is a sleek, silent dangerous fellow Here stands the lonely doe  
Unaware her end is nigh  
Jumps out of the tall grass  
A black-orange mass  
Tearing off her skin  
For the tiger,  
Sustenance has been earned  
For the sweet flesh he has earned  
Deadly as an assasin  
For the tiger it is  
A blessing, a feast and another kill
