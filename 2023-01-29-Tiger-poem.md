In the tropical forests</br>
A deadly predator rests</br>
Silent as a shadow</br>
And has no foe</br>
Top of the food chain</br>
Lurks from the tall grass, bush and cane His eyes burn yellow</br>
And he is a sleek, silent dangerous fellow Here stands the lonely doe</br>
Unaware her end is nigh</br>
Jumps out of the tall grass</br>
A black-orange mass</br>
Tearing off her skin</br>
For the tiger,</br>
Sustenance has been earned</br>
For the sweet flesh he has earned</br>
Deadly as an assasin</br>
For the tiger it is</br>
A blessing, a feast and another kill</br>
