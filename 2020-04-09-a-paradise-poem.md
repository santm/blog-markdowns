#### 2019 August 22nd @ Bangalore ####

I was sitting on a train to paradise.  
I exited with my luggage in the midst of midnight  with wobbly legs,  
I felt like an old soldier with battle fatigue who just came back home.  
The end was near, I hauled a cab & into the resort I went.  
  
I was led to a room & immediately bed I went.  
So tired, I was asleep before the pillow touched my head.  
I woke in the midafternoon, the air humid  
but the golden beach present in blue waters, it was Earth’s beauty.  
I was ever contended.  

I felt like three years old playing in the waves.  
Boy, those were the glorious days.  
But the place was Earth’s heaven.  

I wish could stay there forever  
The land of my happy memories.  
But this place is none other than our own Goa.
