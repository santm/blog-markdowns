As usual, the sun went up early as we are the Eastern part of India, so after a good breakfast and settling our bills we left towards Cherrpunjee. The sky was cloudy but not raining. The 16KM drive is a long one from the resort we stayed and the road of first  8 KM closer to the resort was really bad.  

We started with **Thangkharang Park** which looked farthest on the map. The road was good for the most part but again the last 4/5 KM was under heavy construction. Our legs were heavy from yesterday’s hike still we walked around the whole park. We got to see **Kynrem falls** from there. And Bangladesh plain was in plain sight. The water was not so heavy in
Kynrem falls as we were just before the monsoon. I am sure in monsoonthe sight will be completely different with roaring water rushing down the hill.  The waterfall is made of three or four stages as you can see from the picture. We could see one or two cars on the winding road and there were a few tourists we went to the base of the falls.

From the park, we headed towards **Pillar Rock/Khoh Ramhah** but there was no other soul out there. There was no board explaining what we really need to see. So we felt a little disappointed and just circle back from there.  

On the way back to Sohra we first went to **Mawsmai Cave**, this is a small cave compared to our very own Belum Caves in Andhra Pradesh. But as usual, the cave had its own fun. Some passages were really small and narrow. And you need to be mindful of your steps all the time as there was water. We were followed by a big Bengali group and they were very noisy which really spoiled the fun. Being a Bengali, we really feel ashamed by these large noisy tourists at times.

Anyway as we came out and was looking for some biscuits and snacks from the back the car we realized we left our shoe bag at the resort. We called the resort and they informed yes it was left just out of our door and they have kept it safe. After a quick stop at the **Monoliths** which are on the road itself, we headed back to resort again. We did not stop at Eco-Park and the viewpoint. The drive of 16KM back and forth with the broken and twisted road cost us an hour plus.

After picking up the shoe bag we headed towards **Nohkalikai Waterfalls**. The road is splendid, we stopped many times, we tried the most difficult form of photography aka landscape with little success.

There were lots of spices, pickles and local handicrafts being sold at the viewpoint. 

After Nohkalikai falls we headed back to the Sohra again and stopped at **Ram Krishna Mission**.  This is very close to the ground where my ***Shillong-Cherrapunji Marathon*** ended 2+ years back. This RK Mission played a big role in Meghalaya’s modern history. There is a museum on the first floor highlighting Meghalaya and NorthEast as a whole.  

After RK mission we decided to head back to GHY post lunch. We stopped at the **Orange Roots** a vegetarian restaurant on the highway very crowded.   The food was fresh and hot and it was clean.
