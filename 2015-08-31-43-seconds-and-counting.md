Third year in a row ran [Airtel Hyderabad half marathon](http://www.marathonhyderabad.com/) yesterday. There was many things which were different from 2013. Looking back 2013 was my second outstation race with [PaceMakers](http://www.pace-makers.in/). We traveled in train and return journey was not a great one as we had to travel in sleeper class. The fun was most of us did not had bed linen as we forgot how it was to travel in sleeper class. So Last year though I went with group in train booked my flight ticket for returning and that way I was back home on Sunday itself.  

Coming to 2015 booked air tickets for going as well. Left Bangalore in the Saturday evening as reached Hyderabad in time for an early dinner and heading to bed. My roommate was running full 42.2KM in the toughest city marathon of India. Did not had a good night sleep not from pre-race anxiety but due to poor room quality of WoodBridge Grand. This hotel is getting dropped from our Hyderabad running hotels.  
  
In the morning all the autos were asking exorbitant price in the early to morning to take me to starting point which was only 2 KM away. I kept walking and good Samaritan offered a ride in his car to Necklace Road railway station.  

Was delighted and surprised to meet up with Prithvi Reddy. It is great that he is running and this was his second year doing Half Marathon.

Did proper warm-up with few PaceMakers and was confident for a good enjoyable run. But my Garmin went off before even the race could start :) Not sure what went wrong as I recollect had charged it before leaving Bangalore. Had one large Banana at hotel around 4:45AM & [Clif-Gel](http://www. clifbar.com/products/clif-shot/clif-shot/double-espresso) around 5:45. The digital clock went down before the race director could flag off the race so it was not just me having trouble with watch in the early morning.  

Knew I was running strong as was able to see Brojen in front of me even though the gap between us was widening. Till the first flyover I could see him but  after 5KM mark he really took off.  I had a glass of energy drink around 7/8KM mark and another gel around 11KM with water. I love my coffee. I tried my best to cover up on the downhill parts knowing the course my heart now. Naidu (another PaceMakers) caught up with me around 15KM mark. Asked him what speed he was running and he mentioned something around 5, did not bother with that data as I had only one thing in my mind the last 3 KMs with Gachibowli flyover. Last two years this is where had my trouble and had to walk for few steps. Surprisingly this year there were families with nice Bollywood numbers to cheer runners and I crossed it without much trouble.

But the at the end there was no mark of how much is left and once again there was surprise. As this year also the entry to the stadium was changed and I was not sure how much is left. Only once I saw the stadium entry I started sprinting to the finish line. The clock at the finish line was clicking 1:43:XX and my heart had no joy as at last I felt I cracked the 1:45 mark. I was not super confident with the clock as did not have my own watch to double confirm the same.

With lots of selfies and groupies and chit chat with known runners we headed back for hotel. But getting taxi was not easy but at the end we managed one with bribe ;). The driver switched off his GPS phone with ber. The Uber guys from office  called him few times and he ensured to maintain silence.

The lunch was HUGE at [DineHill](http://www.dinehill.com/) but these year we were very few runners there. But the whole celebration of 1:45 
got busted as soon we reached hotel with SMS from TimingIndia. It said my provisional timing is 1:45:43.

Oh! Now you tell me the value of **43 seconds** and the difficulties I had to explain the same to my non running friends.  It was great  to run at an average 5 KM pace for the whole distance. The weather helped big time but somehow feeling down. In three years my ranking and running had improved [2013 - 2:01]({{< ref "2013-08-28-blessed" >}} "Airtel Hydrabad Marathon 2013"), [20141:50]({{< ref "2014-09-02-airtel-hyderabad-half-marathon-2014" >}} "Airtel Hydrabad Marathon 2014") but I am no longer super excited.  

At last and not the list, thanks a ton to Hyderabad Runners for their execution in a flawless running event. There were volunteers who were excited and enthusiastic not just holding glass of water. The post run arrangement was also great with zero waste. Even though there is nothing new after this 3rd edition for me might comeback one day to complete the ‘toughest city marathon’ one day. Till then ***À bientôt.***
