<p class="has-text-centered is-size-2">The Serene Forests of India</p>
<p class="has-text-centered">


Starting from India’s crown</br>
Lie the craggy white hills</br>
Dotted with pine, moss oak, and maple</br>
Who stand like sentinels</br>
Against the cold wind</br>
They never cry or frown</br>
From the ruthless wind</br>
</br>
On her left hand</br>
Of the west</br>
Lies an ecosystem of sand</br>
Lie plains of gold that shine during the day</br> 
And the skies twinkle in the night</br>
Where the dry shrubs and cacti sway</br>
In the unbearable baking winds</br>
</br>
Greenery adorns her right hand</br>
Evergreen, moist, and conventional</br>
For a beautiful weather</br>
And every year the monsoon wind</br>
Rushes to kiss her hand</br>
</br>
The coastal forests</br>
Near the sea of arabia and the bay of Bengal</br>
Too remain fertile from the tropical wind</br>
Laden with moisture renew life in this part of India</br>
And animals of fur, feather and</br>
Leather comes to make these forests their cozy home</br>
May they be big as goliath or as small as gnomes</br>
</br>
For each forest you oath to visit, you must</br>
Life finds a way</br>
To give every creature a place to stay</br> 
And the forests of India </br>
Was gods place of putting Eden</br>
On the earth's crust</br>
