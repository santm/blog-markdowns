Oh doesn't everyone hate those with an ego,  
With a size bigger than the planet of Pluto.  
Does who think who believe they are better than the common dirt,  
And from their mouth, Nonsense, they spurt   
But they are the worst sickening form of pond scum!  
Just because some  
Are born with the golden spoon in their hideous mouths!  
They feel they are superior than the laws,  
 And feel their position and wealth will help them escape justiceâ€™s vengeful claws!  
  
  
Just ignore those people  
And sharpen  the axe for culling their pride  
To remove their gilded ego and snide!  
Statements they make against the common soul  
Because they don't know us  
For we too can play harsh   
With weapons of revolution  
Of protest and dissent!
