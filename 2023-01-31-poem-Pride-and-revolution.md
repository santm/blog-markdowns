<p class="has-text-centered is-size-2">Pride and revolution</p>
<p class="has-text-centered">
Oh doesn't everyone hate those with an ego,</br>
With a size bigger than the planet of Pluto.</br>
Does who think who believe they are better than the common dirt,</br>
And from their mouth, Nonsense, they spurt </br>
But they are the worst sickening form of pond scum!</br>
Just because some</br>
Are born with the golden spoon in their hideous mouths!</br>
They feel they are superior than the laws,</br>
 And feel their position and wealth will help them escape justiceâ€™s vengeful claws!</br>
</br>
Just ignore those people</br>
And sharpen  the axe for culling their pride</br>
To remove their gilded ego and snide!</br>
Statements they make against the common soul</br>
Because they don't know us</br>
For we too can play harsh </br>
With weapons of revolution</br>
Of protest and dissent!</br>
